# Getting started

To get started with the development on this project, please take the following steps.

## Before everything else

- Make sure that you have an XCode version that supports iOS 14.0 and higher.

## Install Cocoapods and Fastlane via Bundler

- Install [Bundler](https://bundler.io) via `gem install bundler`.
- Run `bundle install` to install Cocoapods and Fastlane.

## Install project dependencies

- Run `bundle exec pod update` to install all dependencies.

## Open the project

Because we use `Cocoapods`, you must `open output-ios.xcworkspace` and not the `.xcodeproj` file.
